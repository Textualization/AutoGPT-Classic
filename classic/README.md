# AutoGPT Classic

AutoGPT Classic was an experimental project to demonstrate autonomous GPT-4 operation. It was designed to make GPT-4 independently operate and chain together tasks to achieve more complex goals.

## Project Status

This is a seldom-maintained fork. Use it at your own risk.


## Overview

AutoGPT Classic was one of the first implementations of autonomous AI agents - AI systems that can independently:
- Break down complex goals into smaller tasks
- Execute those tasks using available tools and APIs
- Learn from the results and adjust its approach
- Chain multiple actions together to achieve an objective

## Key Features

- üîÑ Autonomous task chaining
- üõ† Tool and API integration capabilities
- üíæ Memory management for context retention
- üîç Web browsing and information gathering
- üìù File operations and content creation
- üîÑ Self-prompting and task breakdown

## Structure

The project is organized into several key components:
- `/benchmark` - Performance testing tools
- `/forge` - Core autonomous agent framework
- `/frontend` - User interface components
- `/original_autogpt` - Original implementation
